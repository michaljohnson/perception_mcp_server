"""Place-related drop-pose tools.

Provides `get_topdown_placing_pose`, a single primitive that computes a
top-down drop pose from a segmented (or cropped raw) point cloud.
Two modes selected by `object_height_m`:

  - **Container mode** (`object_height_m=0`, default): drop INTO a deep
    target (bin/basket/bowl). The held object falls vertically into the
    container, so `wrist_z = top_z + top_clearance_m` is enough — no need
    to account for the held object dimensions. Typical caller passes
    `top_clearance_m=0.35`.

  - **Surface mode** (`object_height_m > 0`): set DOWN onto a flat
    surface (table/counter). The held object hangs below the wrist by
    `_GRIPPER_FINGER_LENGTH + object_height_m`. Without that correction,
    the released object clips into the surface. Formula becomes:
        wrist_z = top_z + _GRIPPER_FINGER_LENGTH + object_height_m + top_clearance_m
    where `top_clearance_m` becomes the air gap above the surface (e.g.
    0.05m). Caller passes `object_height_m` per held object (e.g. 0.12 for
    coke can, 0.10 for shoe).

Algorithm (both modes):
  1. Read cached cloud (default) or raw topic; transform to
     base_footprint via cached or fresh TF.
  2. Optional xy crop (raw-depth mode).
  3. cx, cy = mean of points; top_z = 95th-percentile of z.
  4. wrist_z = top_z + clearance correction (mode-dependent, see above).
  5. orientation = strict top-down (1, 0, 0, 0).

PRECONDITION: caller must pre-position the robot so the target is in
camera view and within UR5 top-down reach (target xy distance from base
< ~0.6m). The place agent handles the drive-in when the first drop-pose
call reports a far target. At close top-down range there's no need for
normal-based wall rejection, DBSCAN clustering, or tilt heuristics —
simple statistics are enough.

        Args:
            object_name: Label for the response (informational only).
            top_clearance_m: Vertical clearance above the high-z point.
                Container mode: 0.35m typical (drop INTO bin).
                Surface mode: ~0.05m (air gap above surface).
            object_height_m: Height of the held object in meters. Setting
                this to a positive value enables SURFACE mode and adds
                `_GRIPPER_FINGER_LENGTH + object_height_m` to wrist_z so
                the released object lands at `surface + top_clearance_m`.
                Default 0.0 = container mode (legacy behavior).
            x_bias_m: Forward offset (meters) added to the centroid x
                AFTER mean computation. Use ~0.15 for SURFACE mode with
                the front camera: SAM3 from a horizontal view sees only
                the near strip of a large table top, biasing the
                centroid toward the front edge. A +0.15m bias pushes
                the place pose deeper into the table for safer central
                placement. Default 0.0 = no bias (container mode and
                stage-2 arm-cam refine both have less centroid bias).
            pointcloud_topic: Topic to read if use_cached=False or cache
                empty. Default `/segmented_pointcloud` (SAM3 output).
                Use `/arm_camera/points` for raw arm depth or
                `/front_rgbd_camera/points` for raw front depth.
            use_cached: If True (default) use the SAM3-segmented cloud
                cached by segment_objects(). Set False for raw-depth
                fallback — must combine with crop_center_x/y so the
                algorithm only looks at the target region.
            crop_center_x, crop_center_y: If set, filter points after
                TF transform to within `crop_radius_m` of (x, y) in
                base_footprint. Required for raw-depth mode.
