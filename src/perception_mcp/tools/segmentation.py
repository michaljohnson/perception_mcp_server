"""SAM3 segmentation tool wrapper.

Triggers a SAM3-style segmentation ROS node (GroundingDINO + SAM) by
publishing a text prompt to /segment_text (arm camera) or
/front/segment_text (front camera) and waiting for a status reply on
/segmentation_status. The node also publishes /segmentation_mask and
/segmented_pointcloud (prefixed for the front camera).

The segmented point cloud is cached in memory so that
get_topdown_grasp_pose / get_topdown_placing_pose can read it without
re-subscribing (avoids QoS / timing issues with rosbridge).

Requires: a segmentation ROS node running for each camera you want to
query (arm + front, if both).
