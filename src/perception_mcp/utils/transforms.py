"""TF, rotation, and gripper-geometry helpers shared by the grasping
and placing tools.

In ROS 2 Jazzy, `LookupTransform` is an action (not a service), so we
talk to a tf2 buffer_server action via the WebSocket manager. We use a
namespaced canonical instance at `/canonical_tf/tf2_buffer_server` so
the lookup doesn't race against the five default-named buffer servers
spawned by other rclpy components (MoveIt, rviz, segmentation nodes,
etc.). See `_tf_lookup` for the rationale. The pose-computation tools
(`get_topdown_grasp_pose`, `get_topdown_placing_pose`) call `_tf_lookup`
to bring camera-frame point clouds into the robot's `base_footprint`
frame.

`TOP_DOWN_ORIENTATION` is the quaternion for a strict top-down gripper
approach: 180° rotation about X (the EEF frame has Z-up at rest, so we
flip to Z-down). Used by both grasp and drop poses.

`GRIPPER_FINGER_OFFSET_M` is the distance from the gripper's wrist
frame to the fingertips. MoveIt plans poses for the wrist link, so any
tool computing a fingertip target needs to subtract / add this offset
to convert between wrist and fingertip space.
